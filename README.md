# Hello my name is Todd Glad and I am interested in Data Science.  
I currently work as a Data Analyst for DigiCert.  I love looking into Data Science Projects and finding things in the data.  
I'm hoping that this github repository will be a place where I can track and keep all of my Data Science Projects.  
Currently I have started quite a few but I have not finished them.  Over the next couple of months I will be working on a new one 
looking at data to determine where a good place to live would be.  

## I work in R and am learning Python as well.  My Data Visualization tool of choice is MicroStrategy.  Though I have dabbled in Power BI.
